# Problem Statements:
1. Environment Variable Printer
    Write a script that accepts a list of environment variable names from the user and prints their values. If an environment variable is not set, the script should notify the user.

2. Simple Log Parser
    Create a script to read a sample log file line by line and count the number of lines that contain the word "error" (case-insensitive). Use regular expressions for pattern matching.

3. File Organizer
    Write a script to scan a directory and organize files into subdirectories based on their extensions (e.g., .txt files go into a text_files folder).

4. Basic Docker Image Lister
    Write a script that uses os.system() to run the docker images command and prints a clean, formatted list of Docker image names and their tags.

5. Config File Reader
    Create a script to read a configuration file (e.g., .ini or .conf) and print all key-value pairs. Use string methods and regular expressions for parsing.

6. Simple Kubernetes Pod Status Checker
    Simulate a Kubernetes environment by creating a Python dictionary with pod names as keys and their statuses as values. Write a script to filter and display pods that are in a "CrashLoopBackOff" state.

7. Directory Size Calculator
    Write a script that calculates the total size of all files in a specified directory and prints the result in megabytes (MB).

8. Regex Email Extractor
    Write a script to extract all email addresses from a given string or file using regular expressions.

9. Password Validator
    Create a script to validate user-input passwords based on basic rules:
        At least 8 characters
        At least one uppercase letter
        At least one lowercase letter
        At least one number
        At least one special character (@, #, $, etc.)

10. Basic Backup Script
    Write a script to copy all .txt files from one directory to another. Add functionality to check if the destination directory exists and create it if it doesn't.
