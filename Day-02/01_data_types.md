Data Types

In programming, a data type is a classification or categorization that specifies which type of value a variable can hold. Data types are essential because they determine how data is stored in memory and what operations can be performed on that data. Python, like many programming languages, supports several built-in data types. Here are some of the common data types in Python:

    1. Numeric Data Types:
        a. int: Represents integers (whole numbers). Example: x = 5
        b. float: Represents floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points). Example: y = 3.14
        c. complex: Represents complex numbers. Example: z = 2 + 3j
